The Melbourne Mixtape Exchange Wordpress Theme

The Melbourne Mixtape Exchange is a blog-based site, with some static pages.

The co-creators of The Melbourne Mixtape Exchanged required their design to be coded, along with a corresponding CMS, so that they could add and manage content quickly and easily.

Instead of displaying the entries on the front page in a traditional way, with headings, text and metadata, entries are displayed as an image and a header on the front page, emulating the look of a decorated cassette tape.

The entry is then displayed in full on its single.php page.

Theme includes:
index.php, 
header.php, 
footer.php, 
single.php, 
page.php,
functions.php, 
style.css.

Theme excludes assets such as graphics and fonts.  It does include an external Infinity Scroll plugin.
